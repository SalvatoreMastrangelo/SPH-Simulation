pressure parallel slower than serial? 

density and forces application bottlenecks

cell division optimization leads to approx 6-10x speedup in neighbor search

neighbor search time is the limiting factor now

optimized neighbor search removing sqrt calls

merged pressure and viscosity to single loop
